        <p>Mouth watering pizza woohoo~!!!</p>
        
        <p>Over the years, I've shared a number of homemade pizza recipes on the blog (see here, here, and here), but never one from start to finish - crust & sauce included. In reality, though, we make pizza from scratch fairly often around here. Why? It's one of the few meals we eat where we get to spend time in the kitchen together. I do most of the cooking in our house, but when pizza night rolls around, both of us pitch in.</p>
